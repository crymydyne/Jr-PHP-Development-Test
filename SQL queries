A: 
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM persons;

This query will select the first and last name of every ID in the table.


B:
DELETE FROM persons
WHERE DATE_ADD(date_of_birth, INTERVAL 18 YEAR) > CURDATE();

This query will remove all registers from the table where the age of the person is less than 18 years old, according to the current date.

C: 
SELECT p.first_name AS parent_first_name, p.last_name AS parent_last_name,
       c.first_name AS child_first_name, c.last_name AS child_last_name
FROM persons AS p
INNER JOIN children AS c ON p.person_id = c.parent_id;

In this example, we assume that each kid has the common identifies parent_id to link the children table to the persons table. Using this, we can use inner join to combine the columns parent_id and person_id, as well as selecting the names from each table.
